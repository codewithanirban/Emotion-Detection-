# Emotion-Detection
I worked on an Emotion Detection project using Keras and TensorFlow, where I built a deep learning model to identify human emotions from facial expressions. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), I trained the model on a dataset containing images of faces labeled with different emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, and fear. With Keras as the high-level API and TensorFlow as the backend, I was able to design and implement the model efficiently. The model learned to automatically extract essential features from facial images and classify emotions accurately. I also implemented data preprocessing techniques and hyperparameter tuning to optimize the modelâ€™s performance. This project demonstrated the powerful synergy of deep learning and image processing for emotion detection, with potential applications in areas like sentiment analysis and human-computer interaction.
